{% block abstract %}
Development of simulation methods over several decades has led to the
understanding of many physical phenomena and experimental data.  Hydration of
ions and their interactions with macromolecules are driving mechanisms  for
many biological and chemical processes. The studies on the solvation of ions
have spanned the entire regime of system sizes from small clusters to bulk
solution and interfaces. To understand the solvation of the ions methods of
quantum chemistry, perturbation methods in statistical mechanics, free energy
calculations, and methods for activated processes have been used. This session
intends to bring together scientists who have studied different aspects of the
hydration of ions and their interactions with macromolecules. We aim at
generating discussion about new approaches to bring the field forward.
