Computer simulation has become a powerful tool for a wide variety of fields
such as engineering, weather forecasting, business and finance, science, and
medicine. With the increasing complexity of the mathematical models and the
emerging computing platforms, there is a pressing need to design and analyze
new algorithms which can cope with the computational demands of the
simulations. This symposium will highlight the recent research progress and new
developments in numerical analysis and scientific computing. It will feature a
diverse range of techniques and applications of scientific computing, including
areas in computational finance, computing in biology and medicine,
computational fluid dynamics, data mining, image processing, numerical methods
for partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, computational
methods for optimization, and parallel computing.
