This theme is aimed at exploring research at the interface between mathematics
and industry.  We aim to highlight problems where there is a collaborative and
genuinely two-way interaction between academic mathematicians and
industrialists, in which industrial problems give rise to novel and interesting
mathematics while at the same time providing new insights and innovative
solutions to questions of direct relevance to industry.  Speakers have been
invited to communicate the latest research advances in a number of industry
sectors including banking and finance, agriculture, natural resources, and
energy.
