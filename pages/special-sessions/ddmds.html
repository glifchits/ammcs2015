Large-scale datasets generated by dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science
and engineering. Acquired via observational networks or generated by numerical
models, these datasets have an important special structure, namely that the
samples occur with a time ordering which is the outcome of a deterministic or
stochastic dynamical system. There exists a strong need for data analysis
algorithms to leverage the information content in the data, leading to advances
in problems such as dimension reduction, prediction, and uncertainty
quantification. While the data is extrinsically high-dimensional, in many
applications there is evidence that the data lies near a low-dimensional
structure, nonlinearly embedded in the ambient space.  Modern nonlinear methods
leverage these coarse geometric structures using tools such as localizing
kernels, multiscale bases, or the discrete exterior calculus to represent the
geometry. The aim of this special session is to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of researchers to discuss recent developments in these
topics, having as a common theme the nonlinear, discrete geometry of dynamical
system data.
