{% block abstract %}
This emerging field of computational science is playing a critically important
role in designing new generations of integrated optics modules, long haul
transmission and telecommunication systems. An important part is played by
studies of the behavior of light and light-matter interactions using analytical
and computational models. Possible areas of applications include medical
diagnostics, optical computing, optical communications, and homeland security;
however, it also introduces new challenges in device modeling. This special
session is being organized to share recent developments in the computational
aspect of photonics.
