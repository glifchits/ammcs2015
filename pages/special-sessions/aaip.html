A typical inverse problem seeks to find a mathematical model that
admits given observational data as an approximate solution. This sort
of question is of great interest in many application areas, including
mathematical ecology, environmental systems, physical systems, and
image science, often appearing in the form of a parameter estimation
problem. This session focuses on the applied analysis related to such
inverse problems. The talks in the session will also include aspects
of numerical analysis, mathematical modeling, computational methods,
and applied analysis of direct problems.
