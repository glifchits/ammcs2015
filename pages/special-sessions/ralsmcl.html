Differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including
engineering, physics, economics, and biology. This session is devoted to all
current research on Lie symmetries, conservation laws, and other related
methods used to find analytical or numerical solutions to nonlinear
differential equations. The work presented in this session will form a base for
a forum that provides services for graduate students, post docs, and
researchers in their applications of nonlinear differential equations.
