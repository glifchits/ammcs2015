We propose a minisymposium consisting of two sessions: the first will
deal with single-neuron models and the second with models of networks of
neurons. Traditionally, it has been assumed that spikes (action
potentials) alone are used by neurons to encode and transmit information
but evidence is growing that "fluctuations," subthreshold sinusoidal
oscillations in membrane potential, also play a role. We shall give
attention to both spikes and fluctuations in both sessions. The
mathematics involved has parallel applications to such topics as
predator-prey interactions and disease spread; hence the talks will be
of interest to those working outside the area of neural modeling.
