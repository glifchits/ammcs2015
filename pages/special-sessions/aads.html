The study of dynamical systems has profoundly impacted all areas of science.
In biology, dynamical systems has been used to contain outbreaks of diseases,
explain the emergence of a mutation and demonstrate the spontaneous emergence
of order.   In physics, applications range from cosmological models down to
realm of quantum systems, Bose-Einstein condensation, and nonlinear optics.
Applications of dynamical  systems can be found in sociology and economics. The
concepts of chaos, hysteresis and the spontaneous formation of coherent
structures have changed the way we look at nature.

This theme is devoted to recent advances in analytical studies of dynamical
systems arising in the wide spectrum of applications. The top researchers
working in applied dynamical systems will discuss their recent work in diverse
areas of dynamical systems and applied analysis.
