<h1>Student Prize Competition</h1>

<p>
  Each of the prizes will be judged by a panel that will do its best to attend
  all relevant student presentations. We are asking students to self-identify
  themselves during the registration procedure as well as self-identify to the
  session chair prior to giving a presentation in a special session,
  minisymposium, or contributed session, in order to be considered for an award.
  Four separate competitions will be held for undergraduate and graduate
  students:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>The Best AMMCS-CAIMS2015 Poster.</b> To be eligible, the student must be a
    co-author of the work presented and a designer of the poster. This competition
    will include a 10 minute discussion related to the content of the poster with a
    judging panel. The scheduling for the poster presentations will appear in the
    final program.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The Best AMMCS-CAIMS2015 Student Paper in a Special Session (SS).</b> To be
    eligible, the student must be a co-author of the work and present it during one
    of the “SS” Special Sessions or Minisymposia.
