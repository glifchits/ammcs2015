Recent progresses in the development of parameter free contnuous finite element
methods for compressible fluids

{% block abstract %}
In this talk, I will review the current status of the so-called residual
distribution schemes applied, in particular, to compressible fluid dynamics
problems. Other physical models include the Shallow Water equation and
generalization, MHD, etc.

This schemes, after the early work of R. Ni at Bombardier, and the seminal work
of P.L Roe, in particular his 1981 JCP paper and its extensions to scalar
multidimensional schemes, can be considered as finite element methods of the
streamline diffusion type.The emphasis is put on non-oscillatory properties, in
order to be able to compute flow discontinuities, so that they are non linear
by construction. Indeed shock capturing is done in a totally different manner
as for stream line diffusion, allowing for a class of  parameter free schemes.
In a way, the Residual Distribution methods  can be seen as a kind of
compromise between high order TVD-like finite difference/finite volume  schemes
and classical finite element methods, in that they borrow ideas from both
communities: geometrical flexibility, the residual concept on one side, and non
oscillatory, maximum principle on the other one.  In the talk, we will first
consider the case of steady scalar hyperbolic problems, showing how one can
systematically construct parameter free essentially non-oscillatory schemes.
Then we will move towards steady advection diffusion problems, showing how
uniform accuracy, whatever the Peclet/Reynolds number is. The last part of the
talk will consider recent work on unsteady problems. Examples of compressible
flows  (laminar and turbulent) will be also shown, in order to demonstrate the
efficiency of the method, both in accuracy,  memory foot print and CPU time.

This is a joint work with many colleagues and students among whom Dante
de Santis, Mario Ricchiuto, Algiane Froehly, Adam Larat, Mohamed Mezine at
INRIA, and many discussions with H. Deconinck (VKI, Belgium) as well as Phil
Roe (Michigan, USA). This work has been funded by several EU contracts: the FP6
ADIGMA project (contract AST5-CT-2006-030719), the FP7 IDIHOM project (contract
AAT-2010-RTD-1-265780) and the ERC Advanced Grant ADDECCO (contract #226316),
as well as a grant of the Swiss National Fund.

{% block bio %}
Rémi Abgrall is a former student of Ecole Normale Supérieure de
Saint Cloud.  After his PhD, he has been engineer at ONERA, then research
scientist at INRIA.  Since January 2014, he is professor at the University of
Zürich, Institute of Mathematics, after having been Professor in the University
of Bordeaux (Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux)  since 1996 and in secondment
at INRIA from 2008 till the end of 2013. He has been awarded an Advanced
Research Grant from the ERC in December 2008 and has been invited speaker at
the International Conference of Mathematicians (ICM 2014) in Seoul. He is
associate editor of several international journals, including the Journal of
Computational Physics, Mathematics of Computation, Computers and Fluids, the
Journal of Scientific Computing. He is also co-chief editor of the
International Journal on Numerical Methods in Fluids. His research is about
efficient algorithms for the simulation of compressible materials (single
fluids, multiphase, interface problems, compressible solids) using high order
schemes designed for unstructured meshes. He also has interest in (curved)
meshes generation for high order scheme and model reduction for transport
dominated problems with and without discontinuities in the solution.
