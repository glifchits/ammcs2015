                        <p>"Mankind has always seemed to me as a set of wandering in the fog lights that feel the shine, dissipated by the others, quite vaguely. But these lights are connected in a network of shiny filaments, each in  one, two, three ... directions. And the occurrence of such breaks through the fog to the other light can quite reasonably  be called a "miracle." <em><strong>(Andrey Kolmogorov)</strong></em></p>
