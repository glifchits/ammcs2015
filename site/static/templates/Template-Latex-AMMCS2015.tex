Use this format (without changing the settings) to prepare your one-page abstract. The abstracts are used for evaluation purposes. Therefore, it is important that you describe  your intended presentation concisely and clearly, including the objectives, status, methodology, results, and significance of your study.
 Abstracts may contain equations, figures, and references (see Eqs.~(\ref{eq1}, \ref{eq2}), Fig.~\ref{fig1} and Refs.~\cite{KR,WK,ABS}). {\bf The abstract length is limited to 1  page}.  Equations are to be centered horizontally, with equation numbers aligned with the right margin.  Paragraph text is full-justified.  Do not explicitly begin by writing the word ``abstract''.  Equations should be properly punctuated.  For instance, as
\begin{equation}
y=3x^2\  \  \  \mbox{and}\  \  \  x>0, \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
we see that
\begin{equation}
z=\sqrt{y}=\sqrt{3}x. \label{eq2}
\end{equation}

%\begin{eqnarray}
%\lim_{x \to +\infty} {\rm Abstract}(x) = 1\ {\rm page}.
%\label{eq1}
%\end{eqnarray}
Your abstract should be prepared in \LaTeX\ or MS Word, according to the templates provided, and then \textbf{converted to PDF for submission.}  An online Word$\rightarrow$PDF conversion tool can be found at \url{http://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf/}.  Abstracts not complying with these templates may not be included in the book of abstracts of the 2015 AMMCS-CAIMS Congress. Abstract submission should be done online via the AMMCS-CAIMS-2015 management system at
\url{http://www.ammcs-caims2015.wlu.ca/submit-abstract.html}. We will confirm your submission. If your abstract is accepted, you will be invited to present your talk (either orally or as a poster).
The book of abstracts will be available to the participants prior to the conference and will provide the audience with more information
about the papers being presented at the 2015 AMMCS-CAIMS Congress.

%Only registered participants, who presented their talks at the conference, will be eligible to submit their papers for the AMMCS-CAIMS-2015 Proceedings. Submission of your full paper to the proceedings is not mandatory. All proceedings papers will be refereed. The details will be announced at the website of the conference at \url{http://www.ammcs-caims2015.wlu.ca/proceedings.html}

Your abstract (as a single pdf file) must be uploaded on the conference management
system as soon as possible, but not later than the deadline (\url{http://www.ammcs-caims2015.wlu.ca/deadlines-payment/}). At least one author must be registered for your talk to be included in the program of the conference.
