  The Congress is an international event combining the AMMCS and CAIMS meetings
  at the same location. The AMMCS Conference Series aims at promoting
  interdisciplinary research and collaboration involving mathematical,
  statistical and computational sciences within a larger international community.
  It focuses on recent advances in Applied Mathematics, Modeling and
  Computational Science (AMMCS). The 2015 AMMCS-CAIMS Congress is organized in
  cooperation with AIMS and SIAM.

  The Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society • Société Canadienne
  de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles (CAIMS•SCMAI) has a growing
  presence in industrial, mathematical, scientiﬁc and technological circles
  within and outside of Canada. CAIMS•SCMAI is a member society of the
  International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, which hosts the
  ICIAM Congresses every four years.  The first AMMCS meeting in 2011 was a
  satellite event of this International Congress held in Vancouver.

  The 2015 AMMCS-CAIMS Congress provides a unique opportunity for in-depth
  technical discussions and exchange of ideas in all areas involving
  mathematical and computational sciences, modeling and simulation, as well as
  their applications in natural and social sciences, engineering and
  technology, industry and finance.
</p>
<p>
  It offers to researchers, industrialists, engineers and students to present
  their latest research, to interact with the experts in the field, and to
  foster interdisciplinary collaborations required to meet the challenges of
  modern science, technology, and society.

  Located just west of Toronto in the Canada Research Triangle area, the city
  of Waterloo is home to two universities (University of Waterloo and Wilfrid
  Laurier University), the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics,
  Research in Motion, and many other innovative institutions. The venue of the
  Congress is the Waterloo Campus of the Wilfrid Laurier University, the oldest
  university in the tri-city of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and the Guelph
  areas. It is a beautiful part of Canada located in a comfortable driving
  distance from some of North America's most spectacular tourist destinations,
  including the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to welcoming you in Waterloo on the occasion of this exciting event.
