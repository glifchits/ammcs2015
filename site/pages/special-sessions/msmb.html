Today, mathematical modeling and computational simulations play essential roles
in the advancement of medicine and biology, providing us with a better
understanding of biological systems and disease patterns and ultimately
contributing to the fast development of modern prevention, diagnostic and
therapeutic tools needed for the medicine of tomorrow. The aim of this session
is to bring together mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers,
physicists, and clinicians involved in the area of biomedical sciences to
provide state-of-the-art results and discussion on current cutting-edge
research and open problems. It is hoped that bringing together researchers from
such a wide range of expertise will create the right environment for
dissemination of ideas and fruitful discussions.
