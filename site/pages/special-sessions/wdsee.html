The recent book by T. Piketty (Capital in the Twenty-First Century) shifted the
general attention towards the important issue of wealth inequality. But why is
there wealth inequality? In the last twenty years, physicists and
mathematicians developed models to derive the wealth distribution using tools
of statistical physics: discrete and continuous stochastic processes (random
exchange models) as well as related Boltzmann-type kinetic equations. In this
framework, the usual concept of equilibrium in Economics is complemented or
replaced by statistical equilibrium. This special session is an opportunity to
take stock of the situation and to foster further research in this field.
