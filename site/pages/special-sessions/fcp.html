In recent years, the relationship between time-modified LÃ©vy processes and
related non-local operators has been investigated in depth. Interestingly,
these processes turn out to be useful in modelling several systems in physics,
geophysics and biology and even in the social sciences. In this special
session, recent mathematical results will be presented with an emphasis on
applications.
