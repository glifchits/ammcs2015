This special session will mainly address the general topic of wave theory
including electromagnetic, gravitational, acoustic, and elastic wave
propagation and scattering. The mathematical and numerical modeling techniques
and methods in these areas contribute to a considerable number of real-life
applications. The topic is equally important for fundamental sciences,
engineering, mathematics, and, in particular, for industrial applications.
Among these are problems in radar, gravitational wave detection, sonar, medical
imaging, and wave interactions with surfaces and obstacles. We also intend to
invite researchers working on numerical and analytical methods for other
classes of differential equations. This could prove useful for sharing ideas
and techniques between wave propagation and adjacent fields of research.
