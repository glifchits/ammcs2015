Mathematical models and their analysis continue to provide valuable insights
into the mechanisms and drivers of biological systems from the sub-cellular
to the ecosystem level. Vice versa, biological systems in general, and the
recent increase in high-quality data sets in particular, have spurred and
inspired mathematical research from dynamical systems to computational
statistics. The BioMathematics theme will showcase the most recent
developments in dynamical systems, stochastic modeling, and scientific
computation and their close relation to biological systems, their mechanisms
and emerging patterns.
