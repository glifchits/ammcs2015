Systems of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are routinely generated by
modern simulation tools (e.g. MapleSim, Wolfram System Modeler, OpenModelica).
Various algorithms are applied in the steps from creating a model to a final
mathematically solvable set of equations. Typically, some form of analysis on
the structure of the DAE is performed to determine the index and constraints of
the problem. This is followed by index reduction for higher-index problems.
Many systems are hybrid, meaning that they have discrete equations, typically
modeling state-change events, alongside the continuous ones. State-change may
change the index or other structural properties, so how to handle a possible
multiplicity of states during simulation is an active research topic. This
session is devoted to structural analysis methods and symbolic-numeric
techniques to obtain insights into the mathematical structure of a model, and
the interaction of structural analysis with hybrid systems of DAEs.
