Numerical simulations of real and industrial applications sustained a
phenomenal interest in the last two decades thanks to considerable growth of
computing capabilities. However, complex applications such as fluid-structure
interactions with complex geometries still a big challenges in terms of
reasonable computational costs. Immersing methods including immersed
boundaries, immersed domains, body force method, VOF and so on, are becoming
more and more attractive due to their flexibility to use and their capability
to significantly reduce processing cost. The special session is an opportunity
to discuss and exchange the progress and applicability of such techniques, The
topic covers any work related to these techniques, including any simulation,
numerical or mathematical work.
