Applied Mechanics is perhaps the oldest branch of applied mathematics,
and spans a broad range of theoretical, computational and engineering
methodologies. Modern applied mechanics research is often found at the
interface of traditional divisions, for example those between fluid-like
and solid-like materials. The aim of this scientific theme is to bring
together mathematicians, physicists, and engineers involved in all areas
of applied and computational mechanics to provide broad methodological
overviews, to discuss novel computational approaches and to report on
current cutting-edge research. It is hoped that bringing together
researchers from diverse disciplines will create the right environment
for cross-fertilization of disciplines, idea dissemination across
traditional boundaries and fruitful discussions.
