<h1>Minisymposium (ID: SS-SGT)</h1>
<h2>Structured Graph Theory</h2>
<h3>Organizers: Kathie Cameron and Chinh Hoang, WLU</h3>
<p> Many problems that are NP-complete for arbitrary graphs can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to special classes of graphs.  The polynomial-time algorithms typically exploit the structures of these graphs. In this session, we present recent results in this direction.</p>
