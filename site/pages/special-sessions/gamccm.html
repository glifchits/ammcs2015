<p>
  The aim of this session is to bring together researchers interested in the
  mathematical aspects of mechanics.  Distinguished areas include integrable
  systems and KAM theory,  global analysis, variational methods, differential
  geometry, symmetry and reduction,  differential equations with delay. The
  emphasis will be on the applications of these theories in  celestial
  mechanics, geometric mechanics  (motions of rigid bodies, holonomic and
  non-holonomic mechanics), geometric control, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
  dynamics, statistical mechanics.
