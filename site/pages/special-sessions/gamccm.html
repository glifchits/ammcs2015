The aim of this session is to bring together researchers interested in the
mathematical aspects of mechanics.  Distinguished areas include integrable
systems and KAM theory,  global analysis, variational methods, differential
geometry, symmetry and reduction,  differential equations with delay. The
emphasis will be on the applications of these theories in  celestial
mechanics, geometric mechanics  (motions of rigid bodies, holonomic and
non-holonomic mechanics), geometric control, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
dynamics, statistical mechanics.
