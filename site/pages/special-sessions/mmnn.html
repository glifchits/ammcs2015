  Nanoscience may be defined as confluence of concepts and methods from the
  traditional areas of Science and Engineering towards applications in
  Nanotechnology. Mathematical modeling in this interdisciplinary context has
  become a broadly based and exciting endeavor that helps understand phenomena at
  the nanoscale. This session aims at providing examples of mathematical models
  for problems of current interest in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology.
