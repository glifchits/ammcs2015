<p>
  There has been a growing interest in hybrid systems in recent years. Such
  systems exhibit both continuous (e.g. differential equations) and discrete
  (e.g. difference equations) dynamical behavior and have important
  applications in various industrial and technological areas such as
  communication, complex networks, biotechnology, artificial intelligence,
  switching circuits in power electronics, spacecrafts control, and ecosystems
  management. This special session intends to provide an opportunity to learn
  and share new developments and to present research results in modeling,
  analysis and control in hybrid systems.
