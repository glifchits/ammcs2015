{% block abstract %}
This special session will consider theoretical, as well as applied and computational aspects of functional differential equations, including delay differential,  integral and integro-differential equations. An emphasis will be placed on modeling of equations coming from specific phenomena of applied nature. All aspects of related developments, such as model descriptions, theoretical advances, numerical simulations, feedback impact on original systems, etc. are welcome. Research contributions on other aspects of such equations are encouraged and will be considered for inclusion.
</p><p>
The proposed special session is also intended to be a forum for exchange of ideas and development of collaborative ties between experts on functional differential equations and those in other sciences working on applied aspects of such equations.
