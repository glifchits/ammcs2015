Advances in computing and educational technologies have made Computational
Thinking a new paradigm in education.  Problem-solving using computer
simulation has become a leading skill in the 21 century. Computational thinking
is an approach to solving problems, finding best solutions, designing systems,
and understanding human behaviour that draws on concepts fundamental to
computing. The aim of this special session is to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of researchers to discuss recent developments in
computational thinking and STEM education. It will include, but not be limited
to, computational thinking tools, computational thinking across disciplines,
STEM education across disciplines, graphical programming languages in
education, assessment of computational thinking, tinkering related to
computational thinking, and problem-solving strategies and outcomes.
