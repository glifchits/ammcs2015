Many applications in science and engineering relate to finding low rank
matrices subject to various constraints, i.e. matrices restricted to Riemannian
manifolds. The tools involved include optimization on matrix manifolds and
differential geometry. The applications include molecular conformation, sensor
network localization, low rank nonnegative matrix factorization, and matrix
sensing.
