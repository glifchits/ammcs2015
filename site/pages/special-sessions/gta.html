This special session highlights some of the most recent progress made in Nash
and generalized Nash games, regarding model formulation and computation of
equilibria. Equally of interest are talks on research topics regarding
applications of game theory in economics, engineering, operations research,
health economics and social sciences. The organizers will extend invitations
for speakers in this session, however they are also encouraging direct contact
from researchers in diverse scientific fields whose research lies in the areas
above.
