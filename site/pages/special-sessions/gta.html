The first special session highlights some of the most recent progress made in
Nash and generalized Nash games, regarding model formulation and computation of
equilibria. Equally of interest are talks on research topics regarding
applications of game theory in economics, engineering, operations research,
health economics and social sciences. The organizers will extend invitations
for speakers in this session, however they are also encouraging direct contact
from researchers in diverse scientific fields whose research lies in the areas
above. The second special session will be focused on evolutionary game theory
which was initially developed almost forty years ago by the biologist, John
Maynard Smith, to predict individual behavior in biological systems without
explicitly modeling the dynamics underlying their behavioral evolution.
Nonetheless, the theory has been used to successfully characterize the dynamic
stability of many such models. Recent examples include the Darwinian dynamics
approach that combines behavioral evolution with evolving population sizes and
the adaptive movements methods that investigate the spatial distributions of
species among multiple habitats. The session will feature research advances in
these topics as well as in other areas of game theory applied to biology.
