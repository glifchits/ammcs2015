{% block abstract %}
Motivated by faster supercomputers, recent years have seen tremendous progress
in the development of atomic models and simulation methods in soft matter and
biological systems. This is contributing to our understanding of pathways,
conformational changes, and free-energy landscapes in these systems. Moreover,
predictive tools are slowly emerging from these studies supporting the design
of new bio-molecules and a better understanding of diseases. This session will
bring together scientists that are applying or developing models and/or
simulation techniques to study biological systems and soft matter. We
anticipate that it will motivate state-of-the art discussions while current
cutting-edge research and open problems will be presented.
