The placenta is the interface across which all oxygen and nutrients are
exchanged between mother and fetus. Understanding the development, structure
and function of the human placenta is crucial to gaining insight into the
environment of the developing fetus, whose health is thought to be an important
influence on childhood and lifelong health.
</p><p>
The modeling of the human placenta presents a particularly challenging task
because of the nature of the data required to assess the efficacy of any model.
Several approaches have been taken, ranging from the study of shapes and
morphology (macroscopic), to the structure and function of the vasculature
(mesoscopic), and the diffusional oxygen transport in terminal villi
(microscopic).

This minisymposium addresses several key issues in the acquisition, analysis
and modeling of data from the human placenta. As the ultimate goal is to make
clinically relevant statements, , there needs to be enough data to obtain
meaningful statistics.  But with data acquisition becoming increasingly
difficult with the resolution of the models, new imaging techniques and imaging
processing and methods of data mining must be brought to bear. The invited
speakers in this symposium will address data acquisition, modeling the vascular
network and other aspects of modeling. The symposium will conclude with an
overview of the current state-of-affairs and point to directions of future
research.
