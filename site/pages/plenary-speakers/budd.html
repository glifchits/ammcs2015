<h2>Eight great reasons to do maths</h2>

<h3>{{ plenary[name][0] }} {{ plenary[name][1] }} ({{ plenary[name][2] }})</h3>

<div class='abstract'>
  The UK government has identified 8 great technologies which it believes
  will lead the advancement of science and technology into the future.
  Mathematics underpins all of these and developments of mathematics will be
  the engine for future growth in all of them. In this talk I will describe
  the 8 technologies and look at some of the maths behind them, from Big Data
  through to Energy.

  <!-- from http://www.bath.ac.uk/math-sci/contacts/academics/chris-budd/ -->
  I have broad research interests in interdisciplinary industrial and applied
  mathematics with a particular interest in complex nonlinear problems arising
  in real applications. Typically these involve the solution (analytically or
  numerically) of partial differential equations. A large amount of my work for
  the last ten years has been in numerical weather prediction and data
  assimilation in close collaboration with the Met Office (which I visit very
  frequently). My algorithms are now incorporated into the Met Office
  operational weather forecasting code where they have made a significant
  difference to their accuracy and received a Knowledge Transfer Award. I am
  also working on climate modelling using modern mathematical and computational
  methods and am actively involved in a number of international climate
  modelling networks, including CliMathNet which I co-direct and the Maths of
  Planet Earth programme. I also collaborate with the energy industry, the
  aerospace industry, the telecommunications industry and the food industry.
  Anywhere that maths can be applied is of interest to me.
