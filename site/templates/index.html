AMMCS-2013 is an interdisciplinary international conference in a series of
AMMCS meetings held in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The series aims at promoting
interdisciplinary research and collaboration involving mathematical and
computational sciences, and highlighting recent advances in Applied
Mathematics, Modeling and Computational Science (AMMCS). In 2013 the conference
will be held in the last week of August (August 26-30, 2013). It is organized
in cooperation with AIMS and SIAM and is supported by the Fields Institute.

The conference provides a unique opportunity for in-depth technical discussions
and exchange of ideas in all areas involving mathematical and computational
sciences, modeling and simulation, as well as their applications in natural and
social sciences, engineering and technology, industry and finance.

It offers to researchers, industrialists, engineers and students to present
their latest research, to interact with the experts in the field, and to foster
interdisciplinary collaborations required to meet the challenges of modern
science, technology, and society.

Located just west of Toronto in the Canada Research Triangle area, the city of
Waterloo is home to two universities (University of Waterloo and Wilfrid
Laurier University), the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Research
in Motion, and many other innovative institutions. The venue of the AMMCS-2013
is the Waterloo Campus of the Wilfrid Laurier University, the oldest university
in the tri-city of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and the Guelph areas. It is a
beautiful part of Canada located in a comfortable driving distance from some of
North America's most spectacular tourist destinations, including the Niagara
Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.
