                        <p>"Mankind has always seemed to me as a set of wandering in the fog lights that feel the shine, dissipated by the others, quite vaguely. But these lights are connected in a network of shiny filaments, each in  one, two, three ... directions. And the occurrence of such breaks through the fog to the other light can quite reasonably  be called a "miracle." <em><strong>(Andrey Kolmogorov)</strong></em></p>

                        <p><span class="style9">The establishment of AMMCS interdisciplinary activities at WLU goes back to 2004 when the Center for Coupled Dynamics and Complex Systems was originated, informally combining scientists from the Department of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Computer Science. In the same year, a new interdiciplinary seminar series was established, known as the<a href="http://www.mmcs.wlu.ca/csasm/"> Laurier CSASM Seminar Series</a>. </span></p>
                        <p class="style9">In 2011, when the WLU celebrated its  the 100-th anniversary, its Waterloo Campus became the venue for a major international event in Applied Mathematics Modeling and Computational Science, the AMMCS-2011 Conference. Wilfrid Laurier University is the oldest university in the Cambridge-Kitchener-Waterloo-Guelph area, a beautiful part of Southwestern Ontario located in a comfortable driving distance from some of North America’s major tourist destinations, including the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, Toronto and Niagara Falls. </p>
                        <p class="style9">The AMMCS-2011 conference had an exciting scientiﬁc program featuring nearly 50 special and contributed sessions in several parallel tracks, as well as 10 one-hour talks given by distinguished scientists and mathematicians. Each day of the conference, the scientiﬁc program started with a plenary session that featured one of the conference plenary speakers. The scientiﬁc program of the conference provided a unique opportunity for in-depth technical discussions and exchange of ideas in applied mathematics, computational science and mathematical modeling with their applications in natural and social sciences, engineering and technology, industry and ﬁnance.

                    <p class="style9">Pezhman Hassanpour received his PhD from the University of Toronto in 2008. After his graduation, Dr. Hassanpour joined the University of Waterloo where he held an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship. His research contributions include mathematical and numerical analysis of micro-electro-mechanical and micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems such as sensors and resonators. Dr. Hassanpour has been instrumental in analyzing such systems with deterministic and stochastic mathematical models in energy harvesting applications, biomedicine, health and food industries. His current research interests include also the development of nanotechnology-enabled optical biosensors, nonlinear systems dynamics and control.  At the time of the award he has published five papers in high quality international journals and six conference proceedings.                    </p>
